# Symbolic Aggregate approXimation #

This package implements the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) algorithm in C++ with Python bindings using pybind11. SAX is a time series discretization method that represents a continuous-valued time series as a (sliding window of) symbolic representation(s).

# Installation
Currently, only building from source is available. To build from source, make sure you have a C++ compiler and the header files for your Python version installed.
Download/clone the directory, change into the directory, then install from source using `pip install .`, or, for testing `pip install ".[test]"`.

The project is set up so that pybind11 is installed as a build dependency. The core build has no other C++ or Python dependencies.

You can add this to your own project's requirements with the following entry in your pyproject.toml file:
```
dependencies = [
    "sax-ts @ git+https://github.com/steenrotsman/sax-ts.git",
]
```
