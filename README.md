# Symbolic Aggregate approXimation #

This package implements the Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) algorithm in C++ with Python bindings using pybind11. SAX is a time series discretization method that represents a continuous-valued time series as a (sliding window of) symbolic representation(s).

# Installation
The easiest way to install `sax-ts` is via pip:
```
pip install sax-ts
```

If you want to run the tests locally, install the optional dependencies:
```
pip install "sax-ts[test]"
```

You can then import the `sax` and `paa` functions as follows:
```Python
from sax_ts import sax, paa
```
